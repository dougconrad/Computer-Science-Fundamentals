# SUMMARY

Answer all the questions. Please put your answers _after_ the brackets with
the point count.

## Logistics

### Did you successfully implement everything that was requested?
_Answer "Yes", or state here which parts did not work or which tests did not
pass._ [1 point]

### How long did the assignment take?

_Rather than giving a range, if you are unsure, give the average of the range._
[1 point]

### Who did you work with and how?

_Discussing the assignment with people not on your team is fine as long as you
don't share code. **Please explicitly state (yes or no)** whether you attended any
office hours, and mention any TAs who were especially helpful._ [1 point]

### What was your AI usage?

_State explicitly (yes or no) whether you used AI. If so, say which tools you
used and what your prompts were. Your assignment will not be graded if you do
not answer this question._

### What resources did you use?

_Please give specific URLs (not "Stack Overflow" or "Google") and state which
ones were particularly helpful. State whether you used AI and, if so, which
tools you used and how you used them._ [1 point]

## Mondrian Painter

_What was your addition?_ [1 point]

_May we share your pictures with the class if we especially like them?
If so, should we use your name or keep it private?_ [1 point]

## Reflections

_Give **one or more paragraphs** reflecting on your experience with the
assignment, including answers to all of these questions:_

* What was the most difficult part of the assignment?
* What was the most rewarding part of the assignment?
* What did you learn doing the assignment?

_Constructive and actionable suggestions for improving assignments, office
hours, and lecture are always welcome._
