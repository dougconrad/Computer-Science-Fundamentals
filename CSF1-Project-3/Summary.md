# SUMMARY

Answer all the questions. Please put your answers _after_ the
italicized instructions, as shown in the
[video](https://northeastern.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=d327c168-e0e8-4f70-9f3f-b12f0048baac).

## Logistics

### Did you successfully implement everything that was requested, to the best of your knowledge?

_Answer "Yes", or state here which parts did not work or which tests did not
pass._ [1 point]

Yes.

### How long did the assignment take?

_Rather than giving a range, if you are unsure, give the average of the range._
[1 point]

3 hours.

### Who did you work with and how?

_Discussing the assignment with people not on your team is fine as long as you
don't share code. Please state whether you attended any office hours._ [1 points]

I worked with Rico DeGuzman, and we helped each other out with syntax and motivated each other through the assignment.
I did not attend office hours.

### What resources did you use?

_Please give specific URLs (not "Stack Overflow" or "Google") and state which
ones were particularly helpful. State whether you used AI and, if so, which
tools you used and how you used them._ [2 points]

I used the lecture slides and the kotlin website (kotlinlang.org), both very helpful. I did not use AI.

## Testing and debugging

_Describe your testing and debugging experience, including the following._

* What did you think of writing tests?
* Did you think of edge cases when writing tests that caused you to go back
  and change your implementation?
* Did your tests uncover bugs?
* What was your debugging process like?
* How confident are you in the correctness of your code?

_Your answer should be at least one full paragraph._ [5 points]

Writing tests for this assignment proved to be somewhat challenging for me. Dealing with different return types and
finding all edge cases took a lot of time. I did uncover edge cases when writing tests and had to rewrite some of my
code.
My tests uncovered many (hopefully all) of the bugs in my code. My debugging process was mostly re-writing parts of my
code
with different syntax or with a completely different approach. It was the most challenging part of the assignment. I am
fairly confident in the correctness of my code.

## Reflections

_Give **one or more paragraphs** reflecting on your experience with the
assignment, including answers to all of these questions:_

* What was the most difficult part of the assignment?
* What was the most rewarding part of the assignment?
* What did you learn doing the assignment?

_Constructive and actionable suggestions for improving assignments, office
hours, and lecture are always welcome._

The most difficult part of the assignment was creating tests for all the functions and then debugging them. It took
me a long time to find solutions to the problems identified from the test functions. The most rewarding part of the
assignment was also debugging because of the satisfaction I felt after all of my tests passed and my code ran smoothly.
I learned and got more comfortable with getters and using while loops. I also got more experience creating tests that I
can apply to other projects.
