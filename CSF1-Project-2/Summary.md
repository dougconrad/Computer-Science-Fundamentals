# SUMMARY

Answer all the questions. Please put your answers _after_ the
italicized instructions, as shown in the
[video](https://northeastern.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=d327c168-e0e8-4f70-9f3f-b12f0048baac).

## Logistics

### Did you successfully implement everything that was requested, to the best of your knowledge?

_Answer "Yes", or state here which parts did not work or which tests did not pass._ [1 point]

Yes.

### How long did the assignment take?

_Rather than giving a range, if you are unsure, give the average of the range._
[1 point]

3 hours.

### Who did you work with and how?

_Discussing the assignment with people not on your team is fine as long as you
don't share code. Please state whether you attended any office hours._ [1 points]

I worked with Rico DeGuzman, he helped with syntax, especially when creating functions. He also helped clarify the idea
of method overloading, specifically with fetchAd(). We also helped each other stay on task.

### What resources did you use?

_Please give specific URLs (not "Stack Overflow" or "Google") and state which ones were
particularly helpful. State whether you used AI and, if so, which tools you used and how
you used them._ [2 points]

I used the lecture slides to help with the assignment.

## Thoughts on Targeted Ads

_Write an essay of two or more full paragraphs addressing all the following questions
and justifying your answers._

* What do you think of the targeted ads you receive? Do they seem accurate and helpful?
* How do you feel about your demographics being used for ad targeting?
* What about your health information, location history, browsing behavior, and social
  network?
* Should advertisers be able to include or exclude people based on their demographics,
  health information, browsing behavior, etc.?
* Does it matter if the advertising is for consumer goods or more sensitive areas, such as
  housing or employment opportunities?

_If you use AI or automated tools (beyond a spell checker) to write your answer, explicitly
disclose your usage._ [5 points]

I find that the targeted ads I receive are both accurate and helpful. I see ads that are more relevant to me and
I can discover new products and services that I am actually interested in. Also, if I am researching a product to buy
I like seeing ads for similar products to compare them and make a more educated purchase.
I personally prefer advertisers using my
demographics or personal information for ad targeting, on the basis that the information is only used for that purpose.
Personal information such as health information and location history may be seen to some as an invasion of privacy, but
I personally think that this information is shared so frequently that this use is only of benefit to me, and will
provide
me with more accurate and desirable targeted ads.

####

Advertisers should be able to include or exclude people based on their demographics
and other personal information so that the ads consumers see are more relevant to them. Using this information only
becomes a problem when demographics are used unfairly to marginalize a certain group or type of person.
One example of misuse of demographic ad targeting is targeting or withholding ads from a specific race or ethnicity.
This is especially true of advertising sensitive areas such as housing or employment, because it can unjustly take
away certain opportunities from these groups.

## Reflections

_Give **one or more paragraphs** reflecting on your experience with the
assignment, including answers to all of these questions:_

* Did all the tests from the pre-exercise pass the first time they ran?
  (Usually tests don't all pass.) What was the debugging process like?
* What was the most difficult part of the assignment?
* What was the most rewarding part of the assignment?
* What did you learn doing the assignment?

_Constructive and actionable suggestions for improving assignments, office hours,
and lecture are always welcome._

All the tests from the pre-exercise program most definitely did not pass the first time they ran. Much of my time
spent on this assignment was spent debugging the fetchAd() function. I first reassigned many of the ranges for income
and age to numbers that were easier to work with and did not overlap. I then spent a lot of time rewriting and tweaking
the syntax of the function to make it more concise and easier to work with. The problems in my code were much easier to
see
after this. I made a few small changes and the tests all passed!
All of these factors made the debugging process the most difficult part of the assignment. In turn, this was also the
most
rewarding part of the assignment. When I ran main() and saw all the tests pass, I was overcome with joy. This assignment
made me comfortable using data and enum class, and overall I feel better versed in this language as a whole.
